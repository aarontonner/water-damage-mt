## Geographical Risks and Flood History in Yellowstone County

Yellowstone County’s diverse geography contributes to varying water damage risks across the region. The Yellowstone River, which winds through the county, poses a significant flooding threat during periods of heavy rain or rapid snowmelt. Areas near the river, such as Lockwood and parts of Downtown Billings, have experienced periodic flooding that impacted homes and businesses alike.

## Notable Flood Events in Yellowstone County, MT:

* **2011 Spring Floods:** Heavy snowpack and subsequent rapid melting caused the Yellowstone River to overflow, leading to widespread flooding in low-lying areas. Homes near the river experienced significant basement flooding and structural damage.
* **2019 Late Summer Storms:** Intense rainfall overwhelmed local drainage systems, particularly in Billings Heights and West End, resulting in flash flooding that affected streets, homes, and commercial properties.

#### Unique Soil Challenges in Yellowstone County, MT

The region’s soil composition—a mix of clay and sandy soils—exacerbates water retention issues. Clay-rich areas like South Side Billings are prone to water pooling and slow drainage, increasing the risk of foundation instability and prolonged water exposure.

## Stormwater Runoff Risks in Yellowstone County, MT:

Urban development has increased impervious surfaces, such as roads and parking lots, which contribute to faster stormwater runoff. Areas like West End and Lockwood often face challenges with overwhelmed drainage systems during heavy rain, leading to localized flooding.
